browserbash
===========

Call bash commands through your browser, yeehaw!

Uses [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) and [shoe](https://github.com/substack/shoe) to stream bash's stdin/stdout between client and server.

Instructions
------------

For now, clone the repo and run `node server.js`. Connect to `localhost:9999` and off you go issuing bash commands through a webpage that looks something, but not exactly, like a bash shell prompt.
